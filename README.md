Introduction

The aim of this plugin is the fast rendering of PDF files stored in a database table. 
For this the plugin uses the pdf.js scripts which will render the PDF files much faster than the PDF Adobe addon in the browser. 
This is useful when browsing a PDF database.

The plugin includes a test page and an application process to be able to download the files that need to be printed.
